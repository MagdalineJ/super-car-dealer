# super-car-dealer
This is a simple e-commerce site of large car dealership, made with the help of React.js library.
Of course, car isn't something we buy evryday or in packs, but this site is giving an idea to whoever wants to start a business or wants to buy several cars for friends and family, is mostly welcome; and will have the offer of getting 20% off on the total price including car price and taxes combined. 
The site is made with **react.js** library as been stated before, there is also use of **font awesome icons** . 
I've used basic **HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT** knowledge to build the site.
After clicking the button **buy** a smaller icon of the car and and brand name will pop up in the left edge of the site, alongwith the total cost update.
In order to purchase if the **Purchase** button is clicked , the confirmation will come as congratulations text.
Moreover, by anytime if someone feels that the sellection is incorrect he/she may click on the **Cancel** button; so that the page will refresh and new selection can be made again.
